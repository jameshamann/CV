## James Hamann

My names James, I'm an aspiring full-stack developer looking for exciting opportunities to grow my skills. I have experience in the creative sector, with a degree in Music Technology as well as experience in working within small businesses.
I am looking to join a team who are enthusiastic, keen and passionate about what they do.

## Skills

#### Teamwork and Communication

During my previous job I was part of a small team and had to maintain constant communication in order to let the team manager know
how the project was progressing. Through hard work and enthusiasm I was promoted to a more sales orientated role where I was
communicating directly with clients on a regular basis. As the company was quite small, I found myself involved in multiple roles
and being part of different teams, this improved my teamwork and communication skills massively and I now thrive within a team environment.

#### Learning and Adapting

I'm quite a fast learner and am very quick when adapting to changes. During my previous job, as I had the opportunity to work on different sides of the business, I was regularly asked to change tasks depending on the circumstance. This taught me how to adapt
to changes and also helped me improve my learning process.
